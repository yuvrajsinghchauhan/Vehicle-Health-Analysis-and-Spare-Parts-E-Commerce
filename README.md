Modern world highly depends on AI to solve problems that are challenging to 
human existence and to make human life easy and comfortable. With today’s 
intelligence widely used in automotive industry have helped in solving problems 
related to production and sales. Present industry is what we call 4th industrial 
revolution in which physical and digital systems are working hand in hand to 
provide a better environment that produces data that can be transmuted easily. 
Maintenance is of many types in automotive industries but majorly exist 3 types: 
Preventive – when a Fault is occurred, Corrective – replacement of equipment, 
Predictive – analysis of current vehicle to predict what could be the issue
Automotives are very complex and consist of components like gearbox, brakes, 
and engines and these have sensors and actuators that connected with Engine 
Control Unit make it possible for it to run without any issue. There exist many 
theories and diagnostic tools that can communicate with ECU in which 2 best are 
UDS and OBD2. Due to increase in complexity, focus moved to data analysis 
where in wireless communication and android applications provided the most costeffective way to diagnose automotives. For this, we propose a diagnostic using the 
most basic data that is available on cars and elements like second hand cost 
prediction and insurance premium prediction. This paper uses these data and 
machine learning algorithms and web application of E commers to help customers 
to buy genuine products. Major advantage of this paper is its all-round service to 
vehicle owners to ensure their time and money is saved.
